**Ruby script to write thorugh terminal your Xcode Project**

Just download and run in terminal:
    
    ruby main.rb

You will need to know:

1. Your exact Provisioning Profile. For example:
    
    iOS Team Provisioning Profile

2. Your exact Certificate Profile, that match that particulary Provisioning Profile:

    iPhone Developer: Sofia Swidarowicz Andrade (ABCD3EFGXCZ)

3. And the path of your xcodeproj

This script is working. But still is the Alpha version.
