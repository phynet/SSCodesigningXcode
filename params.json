But, there's a missing step. Signing your xcodeproject. \r\n\r\nUsually you will need to open XCODE and select Provisioning Profile and Certificate...but, if this xcodeproject change, you will have to do this step again, and again, and again. So that's why this script was created, to automate this step (if you're using Jenkins, Bamboo, would be necessary, right?) and make everything easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n##How to use\r\n\r\nSomething to have in mind is that is mandatory now to pass the **path of Provisioning Profile**, because it changes from every user (I don't know yet how to implement this without making the user pass it in CL). \r\n\r\n\r\n    ruby main.rb \"The Name of your certificate\" \"Name of your provisioning profile\" /Users/YourUser/Path-to-your-xcode-project   /Users/YourUser/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\\ Profiles/ \r\n\r\n\r\nYou will need to know:\r\n\r\nYour exact Provisioning Profile. For example:\r\n    \r\n    iOS Team Provisioning Profile\r\n\r\nYour exact Certificate Profile, that match that particulary Provisioning Profile:\r\n\r\n    iPhone Developer: Sofia Swidarowicz Andrade (ABCD3EFGXCZ)\r\n\r\nThe path of your xcodeproj\r\n\r\n    /Users/xxxx/Projects/binary/ios/MyAwesomeProject-1\r\n    \r\nAnd the path of your Provisioning Profile\r\n\r\n    /Users/YourUser/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\\ Profiles/\r\n\r\n##List certificates or provisioning profiles\r\n\r\nAlso I've added two new options to list certificate profiles and provisioning profiles stored in your mac. Right now you can use it like: \r\n\r\n    ruby main.rb cert\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n    ruby main.rb prov /Users/yourUser/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\\ Profiles/\r\n\r\nThis will list all certificates or provisioning profiles.\r\n\r\nThis script is working. But still is the Alpha version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##TO DO:\r\n\r\n    - Change project path to a relative one.\r\n    - Improve use of path of Provisioning Profile. \r\n    - Options helper\r\n    - Improve methods of input options from CL\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
